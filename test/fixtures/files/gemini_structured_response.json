  "biography": "Claude Monet is a painter deeply fascinated by the ever-shifting dance of light and its fleeting impressions upon the natural world. He finds his truest expression in capturing the ephemeral qualities of a landscape, a water lily pond, or the misty atmosphere of a morning. His brush strives to convey not merely what is seen, but what is felt - the very sensation of a moment.",
